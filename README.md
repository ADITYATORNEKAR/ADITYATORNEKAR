## 🚀 Featured Project: HFT Causal Platform

### High-Frequency Trading with Causal Discovery & Multi-Agent Intelligence

A sophisticated analytics platform that isolates true price impact signals from retail sentiment using advanced causal inference and autonomous agents.

### 🎯 Key Capabilities

```
📊 Real-Time Data Ingestion    → Finnhub WebSocket + Alpha Vantage + Reddit Streams
🧠 Causal Discovery Engine     → PC Algorithm + Double Machine Learning  
🤖 Multi-Agent Orchestration   → LangGraph-based decision workflows
📈 Advanced Backtesting        → Vectorized + Event-based simulation with real friction
🛡️  Risk Management            → Human-in-the-loop validation checkpoints
```

### 💡 The Problem This Solves

Traditional quantitative models fail in chaotic markets because they confuse **spurious correlations** with true causal relationships. A Reddit mention and a stock price move appear linked—but are they both responding to the same macro shock?

**Solution:** Rigorous causal filtering to isolate sentiment's true impact on your portfolio.

### 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Backend** | FastAPI + Polars | High-performance analytics engine |
| **Data Ingestion** | Async WebSocket + Token Bucket | Rate-limited, non-blocking data pipelines |
| **Causal Engine** | causal-learn + EconML | DAG discovery & treatment effect estimation |
| **Agents** | LangGraph | Stateful multi-agent workflows |
| **Frontend** | Next.js + Tailwind | Real-time dashboard & backtesting UI |
| **Deployment** | Vercel + Render | Free-tier production infrastructure |

### 📊 Performance Metrics

- **Data Ingestion**: 50-100 concurrent tickers within API limits
- **Sentiment Processing**: ~1000 Reddit posts/10-second window
- **Causal Discovery**: <5 seconds for 100+ variables
- **Backtesting**: 10 years daily OHLCV in <2 seconds
- **Agent Latency**: <500ms signal to execution
